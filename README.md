# Fit-chievements

This was a project for learning React/Redux. I wanted to learn advanced full-stack application features, such as pagination, queryable endpoints and one to many database relationships.

Fit-chievements is a social media application where users can post their fitness related achievements. Recent Facebook trends have frowned upon people "checking in" while they are at the gym, or posting pictures of their bland salads. Fit-chievements solves the problem by offering fitness enthusiasts a place to post their fitness achievements and gain self esteem points and validation from other users.

## Getting Started

If you are a new user click "Register" to signup. Then login with your email and password. To post an achievement type in your achievement or upload a picture to go along with it. You can "like" other user's achievements and follow other users as well. To delete an achievement click the trash icon.

### Installing

Git clone the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/glenrage/fit-chievements.git
cd fit-chievements

npm i
npm run start
```

This installs all packages for the back end, you must install packages for the front end as well. Npm run start will fire up the server.


```
cd fit-chievements/client
npm i
npm run start
```
Now that the server is running, open your browser to
http://localhost:3001


## Running the tests

Tests coming soon
